# Introduction-to-LaTeX

## Pre-Course Instructions

### Preparations

If you use a reference manager (such as Mendeley, Refworks, Zotero, etc), find out how to export its contents as a .bib file. You should be able to find instructions by googling, for instance, "refworks export bib".

If you don't use one of these, choose a reference manager, add a couple of references and find out how to export its contents as a .bib file. The library provides [guidance](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/library/public/Reference-management-software-comparison-final-version---2021.pdf) on the different reference managers available to help you choose. The library also has some [resources](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/learning-support/reference-management/) to get you started with various reference managers.

### Self-Study Instructions

You can download the course materials [here](https://github.com/coolernato/Introduction-to-LaTeX/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Open the file ```Intro to Latex Slides.pptx```. When reading through the slides, refer to the notes section of the slides, which contains further explanation of the content of the slides. The notes also often contain links to Overleaf projects which contain full projects centred on the feature being demonstrated in the slides.

When the slide says "Problem Sheet" in the upper-right corner, this indicates there is an exercise available in the problem sheet [`problem_sheet.md`](problem_sheet.md). It is recommended to complete the exercises from the problem sheet, with the exception of the last exercise, in an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) project. This will see you build a document with a variety of different features which you can than copy into other documents when you need them.
