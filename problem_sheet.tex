\section{Referencing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Go back and add labels to your sections, subsections, equations, figures, and tables
\item Write some text and reference each of the labels you just added
\end{itemize}

\section{Bibliographies}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a .bib file (you can export from a reference manager or create one from scratch)
\item Include the bibliography in your .tex file
\item Cite some of the bibliography entries in your document
\end{itemize}

If you receive an error, check the following common issues:

\begin{itemize}

\item Open \href{https://www.overleaf.com/read/gnzphcnqgfvf}{this LaTeX project}
\item Make a copy of the project
\item Correct the errors and compile the pdf
\item If you get stuck or want to compare your answer, the corrected version can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/read/zsmyvxvdcvfr}{here}
